## Gargee's Dreamscape — Implementation Plan

### Step 0: Recreate Existing App from GitHub
Bring in the complete existing codebase from your GitHub repo into this Lovable project, including all current components:
- **Navbar** with navigation links
- **HeroSection** with dreamy hero design
- **StarryBackground** with particle effects
- **MemoryLane** (memories section)
- **GallerySection** (dream gallery)
- **DreamJournal** (journal section)
- **Soundscape** (music/ambient sounds player)
- **DreamGames** (games section)
- **AboutSection**
- **Footer**
- **LuminaOrb** (floating AI companion with chat)
- **ThemeToggle** (dark/light mode)
- **LoadingScreen** (current version)
- All existing styles, animations, and assets

### Feature 1: Super Magical Loading Screen ✨
Completely redesign the loading screen into a breathtaking 2–2.5 second dream entrance:
- **Nebula background** with slow-moving soft clouds and twinkling stars that react to mouse movement
- **Crystal orb** at center that blooms open like a lotus flower, revealing a glowing heart with "G" inside
- **Floating polaroid photos** of Gargee gently rising from bottom, fading in/out like cherished memories
- **Poetic phrases** appearing one by one: "Weaving dreams for you...", "Where love lives forever...", "For my Gargee... 💕"
- **Heart-shaped progress indicator** made of glowing stars that connect and light up when loading completes
- **Exit transition**: orb bursts into soft sparkles, screen fades out with scale + blur effect

---

### Feature 2: "Read My Book for Gargee" 📖
Add a glowing matte-glass button in the Hero section that opens a full-screen book reader:
- **Beautiful cover page** with title and Gargee's photo
- **Smooth page-turn animations** with chapter navigation
- **Matte glass page backgrounds** with soft, elegant typography
- **Side chapter list** (responsive for mobile)
- **Next/Prev navigation buttons** with glow effects
- Filled with **placeholder loving chapters, poems, and dream stories** about Gargee (ready to be replaced with real content later)

---

### Feature 3: Add 4 Songs to Soundscape 🎵
Add the uploaded songs to specific soundscape categories:
- **"Finding Her"** → Ethereal Music category
- **"Birds of a Feather" (Billie Eilish)** → Gentle Rain category
- **"I Like Me Better" (Lauv)** → Wind Chimes category
- **"Sharmeeli" (Frappe Ash)** → Ocean Waves category

Each song will be properly integrated with the existing Soundscape player UI.

### Feature 4: Add 5 Photos to Dream Gallery 🖼️
Add all 5 uploaded photos to the existing dream gallery section:
1. Gargee in green dress with fairy lights
2. Gargee close-up portrait (warm tones)
3. Gargee at pink carnival/event
4. Gargee with family member at sunset pier
5. Gargee with dad selfie

Each photo will have a dreamy caption and integrate with the existing gallery layout and animations.
